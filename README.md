**PLEASE! Remember not to directly commit to the _master_ branch!**
When working on a subsystem, commit all changes to a branch dedicated to said subsystem's development. When the subsystem is complete, open a pull request and the subsystem will be looked over, tested, and then merged with the master branch.

## Setup For Coding

### If you are using Eclipse (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository (Preferably the branch you are working on, _not_ master)
2. Set your Eclipse workspace to [Location]/DuckSouls-Workspace
3. Import the existing Java project "DuckSouls"

### If you are using anything other than Eclipse
1. Clone the repository (Preferably the branch you are working on, _not_ master)
2. The \*.java files are in [Location]/DuckSouls-Workspace/DuckSouls/src/

Viola!
